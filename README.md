## CAPTCHA Recognition
- A deep learning model built to accurately decipher and recognize CAPTCHA text.
- The model is trained using a public dataset available in Kaggle. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawon10/captcha)
- The model uses CRNN architecture which combines the potential of CNN and RNN.
